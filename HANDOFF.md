# Handoff

## 2026-06-26 - Phase 1 Models

Work completed:

- Implemented the Phase 1 Pydantic v2 model layer in `models.py`.
- Added strict construction-time validation for Phase 1 contract requirements, including score bounds, required reviewer approval for approved Ledger records, timezone-aware timestamps, source/snapshot provenance, ordered non-overlapping offsets, exact Ledger statement fields, and synthesis section stance compatibility.
- Added `tests/test_phase1.py` with valid and invalid model construction coverage.
- Added `.agent/plans/phase-01-models.md` and updated `.agent/PLANS.md`.
- Updated `STATUS.md` for Phase 1.

Important constraints:

- Stop at Phase 1 unless the user explicitly requests Phase 2.
- Do not implement database operations, web retrieval, scraping, LLM calls, orchestration, rendering, SDK integrations, web frameworks, ORMs, or HTTP clients yet.
- Continue passing Pydantic model instances between internal stages; do not pass raw dictionaries except at persistence, API, logging, or export boundaries.
- Preserve the separate `evidence_quality` and `claim_fit` fields; do not add any composite evidence score.

Verification:

- `pytest tests/test_phase1.py`: 16 passed.
- `ruff check .`: passed.
- `ruff format --check .`: passed.

Open issue:

- The direct `pytest`, `python`, and `ruff` commands were not available on PATH. I created a local `.venv` with only the already-declared project/dev dependencies to run verification. The sandbox blocked recursive cleanup, so `.venv/` remains as an untracked local tooling directory.

Next expected phase:

- Phase 2 should begin only after explicit user direction and should build on the typed contracts without introducing raw-dictionary handoffs.

## 2026-06-26 - Phase 0 Foundation

Work completed:

- Documented the Phase 0 architecture corrections requested by the user.
- Added the repository scaffold needed for reliable AI-assisted development.
- Configured `pyproject.toml` for Python 3.11+, Pydantic v2, python-dotenv, pytest, and Ruff.
- Added a Phase 0 scaffold/configuration test.
- Verified the phase with `pytest`, `ruff check .`, and `ruff format --check .`.

Important constraints:

- Do not begin Phase 1 without explicit user instruction.
- Do not implement working agents, SQLite behavior, web retrieval, scraping, LLM calls, SDK integrations, ORMs, web frameworks, or HTTP libraries yet.
- Future assistants must read `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` completely before editing.
- Internal handoffs must use Pydantic model instances, not raw dictionaries.

Open issue:

- No blocking Phase 0 issue remains. `.agent/plans/phase-00-foundation.md` is the canonical plan; `.agents/PLANS/phase-00-foundation.md` is only a compatibility pointer.

Next expected phase:

- Phase 1 should start only after the user explicitly requests it. It should begin with schemas and artifact-store design as described in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, without weakening the Phase 0 constraints.
